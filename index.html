			confidential : songs I listen to. 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgIDG4fH7wI"> NSG After Ot Bop</a> This is a jam, for real. You will dance to that and bounce. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_D3VFfhvs4">Michael Jackson Smooth Criminal</a>A tragic story in a dark atmosphere delivered by an entertaining and groovy music. A strange and efficient mix that always gets me. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUU1bIWpH5c">Rema Dumebi</a>This song is a jam too. Funny thing about its conception : the chorus is rubbish, it does not mean anything. Rema sang the topline without lyrics and his manager told him to keep it like that haha. You might also like the remix with the amazing Becky G <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYKWJ8gzZRU">Remix with Becky G</a> What ? You want to listen to more of her ? I got you. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMFewiplIbw">Becky G ft Bad Bunny - Mayores</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPZE34y3JTM">Muchacha</a> Alright. All these songs are really groovy and make you want to dance but what if we want to chill eh ? Your man got you. Here is a little selection of chill songs for a relaxing time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJPbgDQCdYo">Tyla Yaweh ft French Montana - Salute</a> Tyla really brought that rockstar vibe. Let's have a look at an even rock-ier and star-ier rockstar.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJPbgDQCdYo">Trippie Redd - Love Scars</a>. Last but not least : the don. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r-nPqWGG6c">Don Toliver - No Idea</a>. This one hits different. I can't wait for his next album to drop : L.O.A.D. or Life Of A Don.
